# LeetCode Coding Exercises

Welcome to the LeetCode Coding Exercises repository. This repo is designed to help you prepare for coding interviews by providing not just solutions, but also a deep understanding of the problems and their real-world applications.

## Structure

Each problem is organized in its own folder, containing:

-   **README.md:** A detailed explanation of the problem, including analysis, plan, and execution.
-   **real_world_example.[language]:** A small real-world project or use case that helps solidify the concepts.
-   **solution.[language]:** The LeetCode problem solution, which you should only refer to after attempting the problem yourself.

## Approach

For each problem, follow these steps:

-   **Read the problem**: Understand the problem statement, constraints, and what needs to be solved.
-   **Evaluate possible solutions**: Brainstorm different approaches and decide on the best one.
-   **Analyze complexity**: Consider the time and space complexity of your chosen solution.
-   **Code implementation**: Write clean, efficient code to solve the problem.
-   **Test the solution**: Test your code with various edge cases to ensure it works correctly.

Happy coding!
